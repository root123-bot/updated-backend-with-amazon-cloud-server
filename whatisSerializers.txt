TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SERIALIZERS DO IS GO TO THE HACKING COURSE AND GRAB THE CONCEPT OF THE SERIALIZERS... IN THAT CASE ITS SAY IS THE 
PROCESS IN WHICH THE DATA IS RELAYED/CONVERTED IN FORMAT THAT CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO THE OTHER ENDPOINT. SO HERE WE APPLY THE SAME 
CONCEPT IN DJANGO YOU'VE SEEN serializer MODULE AND YOU SEE IT CONTAINS THE FIELDS AND SO ON.. SO THOSE FIELD IS USED AS A FORMAT OR 
CONTAINER TO HOLD THE REPRESENTATION OF THAT DATA TO OTHER ENDPOINT, SO IN THIS CASE I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THESE field LIKE product=CharField()
IS ONLY USED TO FORMAT THE DATA TO OTHER ENDPOINT BUT IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE ACTUAL PRESENTATION OF THE DATABASE.. IF MODEL HAS THREE FIELDS LIKE
name, price, title AND SERIALIZERS CAME WITH MAYBE 5 fields (name, price, title, url, email) THIS IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE MODEL NOW IS 
CHANGED TO 5 fields BUT WHAT IT MEANS IS IT SUPPLIES THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCE TO THE ENDPOINT TO BE USED WHEN ACCESSES, THIS CONCEPT YOU SHOULD
UNDERSTAND AND KEEP IT IN YOUR HEAD DON'T CONFUSE... SO THE SERIALIZERS JUST GIVES US A CHANCE TO DO SOME LOGICS TO ENDPOINT LIKE TO ADD SOME 
VALIDATION AND SO ON THIS IS HOW I LOVE THE SERIALIZERS API... serializers acts as Forms.py which decide which fields or data should be 
presented to the endpoint
